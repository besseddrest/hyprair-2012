# HyprAir 2012

A step-by-step "guide" for installing Arch Linux, Hyprland, and the HyDE desktop environment on a 2012 Macbook Air

Before you read any further: This guide will use `archinstall`. Hate it or love it, to get my machine configured correctly it took quite a bit of tries, and the install script just made the process tolerable. If you want a manual install, be my guest; I've done that too in prior attempts and I always end up messing something up.

## Intro

The 2012 Macbook Air has been my ride or die since purchasing it new on
a friends Apple discount, but over the last year it has been sitting idle with
a fresh 1TB SSD inside. I wanted to give it new life and at the same time, dive
into Arch Linux, and see if it could handle HyDE.

And I'm happy to say that it runs pretty dang well on machine! Of course the fan
runs any time I play YouTube but it never slows down - my 2017 Macbook Pro, on
which I've tried a dual boot - does.

After lots of research, Reddit questions, random help from YouTube, I thought it
would be appropriate to pay it forward and document the installation process,
for anyone who has been interested in attempting to rice an old Apple machine.
More importantly this contains info about the special/additional configuration
I needed, and the mistakes that I made along the way - hopefully so you don't.
